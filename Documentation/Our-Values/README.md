# Our Values And Principles

## The Two Founding Principles

There are two self-evident and inviolable rights that we, the founders, give to all the members of our online community:

1. **The Right to Anonymity**  
We treat all data security extremely seriously. But, the safest way for us to fully ensure our members' anonymity and privacy is by *refusing* to keep any personally identifiable information about them.

1. **The Right to Self-Governance**  
As other giant social media companies expand, just like  governments, they turn into autocracies. Yet we want our online community to be ruled by its members; not by any external forces, and not by the founders.
