# Values And Guiding Principles

## Two Fundamental Principles

There are two self-evident and inviolable rights that are given to all the members of the Alpha Social Club community:

1. **The Right to Privacy**  
Privacy is inviolable. Thus, we require all the members to be anonymous. This social space shall not keep any privately identifiable data about members. We explicitly refuse and forbid to store any such information.  


2. **The Right to Self-Governance**  
Self-governance is inviolable. The members shall establish, judge and enforce rules, and direct the development and growth of the community. This social space shall not be an autocracy run by a corporate entity.

## Corollaries

### Initial formation

In accordance with the second principle, the role of the company is not to govern but to establish the initial settlement. After the establishment, the company representatives shall step down.   

It is important to recognize that a sufficient number of members must exist in order for the community to be able self-govern itself.

### Transparency

A dichotomy exists between individual *[Right to Privacy](#two-fundamental-principles)* principle and the information freedom: the transparency. Thus, the dichotomy must be resolved through the community discussion, voting  and establishment of rules on a case-by-case basis.

During the initial formation of the community, it is inevitable that the company shall make judgment calls where such dichotomies exist. In the future, the company-established rules may be modified through the community self-governance process.

### Open Source

The company supports open source community and makes all software and system development documentation available [freely to the public](/LICENSE.txt). Go ahead and fork us. Please.

Indeed, we are deeply grateful to and inspired by all the pioneers of open source software that preceded us. It is thus the company's grand dream to enable a movement of a true *Open-Source Self-Government*. Wouldn't that be grand!

### Status Ranking

During the initial formation of the community, the company shall establish a ranking system that awards each member for his/her contribution to the community. The self-government leaders shall be selected from the top contributors.

For example, any activity such as a vote, a forum post, an invitation code issuance, or a new member registration will be awarded points increasing the member ranking.

The initial ranking rules shall be openly published. At a future time, once the self-government has been established, the rules can be modified following the community debate and vote.
