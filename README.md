#AlphaSSS (Self-governing Social Space).  What is it?

###Our Fundamental Values

`1` AlphaSSS is a vision of an **online nation** with its own government, micro-economy and *strategic action fields*<sup>TODO: explain</sup>. It is only a vision for now since we are developing it as we speak.  

`2` AlphaSSS is **pseudonymous**. Absolutely no personal information is collected. Anonymity does not imply criminality or nefarious intent, but the right protected by the Constitution (of my country, United States). Anonymity means liberty. Freedom.  

`3` We believe that **cryptocurrency** is the future of financial economy. That's why we believe in Bitcoin. AlphaSSS will always be free to use. Any token donations will be appreciated.
