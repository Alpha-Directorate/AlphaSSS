## What is this project?
(XXX—needs revisions. we are adult content, but no explicit content, as governed by community. Adult discretion required.)
Alpha Social Club is a social environment for members to explore their sexuality in non-pornographic context. Sex is one of the most fundamental social activities.

## The Project Vision Outline
1.	**Sexuality is healthy.**<br>It mediates biological, physiological processes (allostasis). It builds social relationships. It stimulates brain cognition and slows down aging processes.

2.	**Sexuality is private.**<br>Scientists tell as that humans are quite a unique members of the animal kingdom that prefer to have sex in private… (Who would've thought?)

5.	**Pornographic visual media are not permitted.**<br>As the corollary to the above, we do not permit porn. Porn is a public manifestation of sexuality. But private sexual encounters online are OK.

3.	**Personal data privacy is absolute.**<br>We are paranoid about your privacy. We collect absolutely no personal information; e.g.: we strip IP addresses; and do not collect email addresses. [Read more...](http://www.alphasocial.club/where-has-our-privacy-online-gone/) `(admin / Alpha.Omega)`

4.	**Club membership is by invitation only.**<br>Firstly, invitation-only membership creates a certain level of exclusivity. Secondly, it helps us further control and safe-guard minors' participation.

10.	**The club is all-inclusive.**<br>To exclude anybody from our club based on sexual orientation or gender identity would be shameful and absurd. Everybody (who's adult) is welcome.

6.	**Community governed.**<br>Our intent is to establish a self-governed social environment. Call it the "wisdom of the crowds", or in scientific parlance a "swarm intelligence".

7.	**Membership is free.**<br>No ads. No fees. No catch. We want to create the spirit of the truly organic and natural growth (pun intended) of like-minded, friendly community.

8.	**Revenue based on voluntary donations only.**<br>As a footnote to the above, we are a company who expands significant costs to run the infrastructure and pay developers. Donations are always welcome.

9.	**Openness and transparency.**<br>This project is completely open-sourced to the online community. Of course, we must except any security-sensitive data or code (accessible to admins).
