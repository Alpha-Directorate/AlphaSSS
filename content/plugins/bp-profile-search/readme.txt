Let visitors search your BuddyPress Members Directory and their Friends list.

== Description ==

With BP Profile Search you can build one or more customized forms to let visitors search your BuddyPress Members Directory and, if they are Members, their Friends list.

You can insert the search forms in your Members Directory page, in a sidebar or widget area, or in any post or page without modifying your theme.

When visitors click the *Search* button, they are redirected to your Members Directory page showing their search results. The *All Members* tab shows all the results, while the *My Friends* tab shows the results found among your visitor's friends.

Requires at least BuddyPress 1.8 -- Tested up to BuddyPress 2.0.2

== Installation ==

After the standard plugin installation procedure, you'll be able to access the plugin settings page *Users -> Profile Search*, where you can build and customize your search forms.

= Form Fields =

In this section you can:

* Add and remove form fields
* Enter the field label and description, or leave them empty to use the default
* Enable the *Value Range Search* for numeric fields, or the *Age Range Search* for date fields
* Change the order of the fields

= Add to Directory =

With this option you can insert your search form in your Members Directory page. If you enable *Add to Directory*, you can also:

* Enter the HTML text for the optional form header
* Enable the *Toggle Form* option
* Enter the text for the *Toggle Form* button

= Form Method =

With this option you can select your search form *method* attribute, POST or GET.

If you choose GET, the form data are sent as URL variables and users can bookmark the results page; if you choose POST, the form data are not visible in the URL and it's not possible to bookmark the results page.

= Text Search Mode =

With this option you can select your text search mode, between:

* LIKE: a search for *John* finds *John*, *Johnson*, *Long John Silver*, and so on
* SAME: a search for *John* finds *John* only

In both modes, two wildcard characters are available:

* Percent sign (%): matches any text, or no text at all
* Underscore (_): matches any single character

= Display your search form =

After you build your search form, you can display it:

* In your Members Directory page, selecting the option *Add to Directory*
* In a sidebar or widget area, using the widget *Profile Search*
* In a post or page, using the shortcode **[bps_display form=ID]** (*)
* Anywhere in your theme, using the PHP code<br>
**&lt;?php do_action ('bps_display_form', ID); ?&gt;** (*)

(*) Replace ID with your actual form ID.
