== Description ==

Featured on wpmudev: http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/12-surprisingly-useful-wordpress-plugins-you-dont-know-about/
Cheers for the review, folks!

**footnotes** aims to be the all-in-one solution for displaying an automatically generated list of references on your Page or Post. The Plugin ships with a set of sane defaults but also gives the user control over how their footnotes are being displayed.
**footnotes** gives you the ability to display decently-formated footnotes on your WordPress Pages or Posts (those footnotes we know from offline publishing).

= Main Features =
- Fully customizable **footnotes** shortcode
- Decide, where your **footnotes** are displayed (position of the *Reference Container*)
- Add custom CSS to style the appeareance of the **footnotes**
- Responsive *Reference Container*
- Mouse-Over Box with clickable links displays your **footnotes** text
- Automatic numbering of your **footnotes**
- Choose from a list of symbols to represent your **footnotes**
- Display the **footnotes** *Reference Container* inside a Widget
- Button in both the Visual and the Text editor
  - Add **footnotes** into your Page / Post with ease of use by selecting your text and clicking the button

= Example Usage =
This is an example. Please note, that you can customize the shortcode you want to use.

1. Your awesome text((with an awesome footnote))
2. Your awesome text[ref]with an awesome footnote[/ref]
3. Your awesome text`<fn>`with an awesome footnote`</fn>`
4. Your awesome text `custom-shortcode` with an awesome footnote `custom-shortcode`

= Where to get footnotes? =
The current version is available on wordpress.org:
http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/footnotes.zip

= Support =
Please report feature requests, bugs and other support related questions in the WordPress Forums at https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/footnotes

Speak your mind, unload your burdens. Notice how we screwed up big time? Bring it to our attention in the above mentioned WordPress Forums. Be polite, though :)

= Development =
Development of the plugin is an open process. Latest code is available on wordpress.org

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is your Plugin a copy of footnotes x? =

No, this Plugin has been written from scratch. Of course some inspirations on how to do or how to not do things were taken from other plugins.

= Your Plugin is awesome! How do I convert my footnotes if I used one of the other footnotes plugins out there? =

1. For anyone interested in converting from the FD Footnotes plugin:
Visit this swift write-up from a **footnotes** user by the name of **Southwest**: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-make-this-footnote-style?replies=6#post-5946306
2. From what we've researched, all other footnotes Plugins use open and close shortcodes, which can be left as is. In the **footnotes** settings menu, you can setup **footnotes** to use the existing (=previously used) shortcodes. Too easy? Yippy Ki-Yey!
= I'm happy with how the Plugin works =
1. Pour a glass of your favourite beverage
2. Take a deep breath
3. Donate whatever amount you think is appropriate here: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=BYSY26N8L8VJC

5. Now it's time to empty that glass in one go
