Integrate chat into your WordPress website. Allow users to discuss in public and private chat rooms. Skyrocket user engagement by 200%.

== Description ==

iFlyChat is a real time **chat** plugin best suited for **community** and **social networking websites**. It helps in increasing user engagement of your WordPress site by enabling users to **chat with each other privately** (one to one private conversation), **group chat** or in **chat rooms**. Also, it is useful for forums, blogs, dating sites etc. It can also be configured to provide **online support** for products/services. It logs the user conversations so that they can be later viewed using shortcode. You can try it out live [here](https://iflychat.com/features?refid=wp).

####Chat Features####

* **One on one (private) chat**: Attractive Pop Up Chat. Interact with users and customers online using public and private rooms. Users can browse and chat simultaneously.

* **Embedded Chat Room**: Make different chat rooms into separate pages. Fully customisable CSS. [Try demo here](https://iflychat.com/embedded-chatroom-example-public-chatroom?refid=wp).

* **Group Chat**: Group chat enables users to chat in groups. Users can chat with specific set of people simultaneously. (Premium feature)

* **Anonymous Users**: Anonymous or unregistered users can be allowed to participate in the chat. Such users are assigned random names or numbers (configurable option).

* **Cloud based chat**: Blazing fast response time. Sub second latency. All chat related processing for your website is handled by our cloud servers. There won't be any chat related load on your website server.

* **Chat Moderation**: Control swearing in public or private chat rooms. Spamming of URLs can also be stopped by setting up chat moderation at settings page.

* **Delete Chat Messages**: Chat Moderator or Administrator can delete a message or clear entire history of any chat conversation. This feature can also be switched off.

* **User Moderation**: Chat Moderator or Administrator can kick or ban (even IP based ban) users who do not abide by the rules and regulations of the chat.
