-- Stylesheet locations --

All stylesheets (excluding 'buddyboss-slides.css')
are called from /buddyboss-inc/theme-functions.php and are located
in the /css/ folder.

'buddyboss-slides.css' is called from /buddyboss-inc/buddyboss-slides-loader.php
and is located in the /buddyboss-inc/buddyboss-slides/ folder.


--- If you are editing CSS via the WordPress admin, do the following ---

1. Install the plugin WP Editor: http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-editor/
2. Navigate to Appearance > Theme Editor in the WordPress admin.
3. Navigate into the /css/ folder of your child theme to edit custom.css.


--- The styles are loaded in the following order ---

1. buddyboss-slides.css 			BuddyBoss homepage slider
2. wordpress.css 					WordPress styles (always loaded)
3. buddypress.css 					BuddyPress (only if BuddyPress is activated)
4. bbpress.css						bbPress (only if bbPress is activated)
5. plugins.css 						Support for 3rd party plugins
6. adminbar-mobile.css				adminbar (for phones) left and right slide out panels

7. adminbar-desktop-fixed.css		adminbar (for large screens) set to 'Full Width' in Appearance > Customize
7. adminbar-desktop-floating.css	adminbar (for large screens) set to 'Float Right' in Appearance > Customize

The later on a stylesheet is loaded, the higher precedent it gets.
So for example, if you define a CSS element in custom.css that has already
been defined in wordpress.css, the version in custom.css will be used.

Each stylesheet includes a table of contents to help you navigate
through it. You will notice that many of them include a section with
media queries. Media queries allow us to detect a browser's screen
size, and load specific styles only if the screen is larger or smaller
than that particular size. This allows us to define a large set of
global styles, and then specific styles for phones, tablets,
and desktops & laptops - just based on the predicted screen size
of these devices. That's boss!
